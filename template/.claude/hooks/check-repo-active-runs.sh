#
# Emits a banner when the current working directory is inside a repo that
# is currently owned by another Claude session running /run-project,
# /execute-task, or similar. The banner tells the new session to:
#   1. Avoid edits (they will be hard-blocked by block-on-active-run.sh)
#   2. Branch into a git worktree for parallel work
#   3. Or wait for the owning session to finish
#
# Runs the registry 'check' subcommand from a "foreign" perspective by
# passing pid=0 session=__new__ so the registry returns all covering
# entries (there is no match-self exception yet — this is a fresh session).
#
# Exit codes: always 0 (SessionStart hooks cannot block session startup)

WARNING: This directory is inside a repo currently owned by another Claude session.
Concurrent edits, deletes, and dangerous bash will be HARD-BLOCKED by block-on-active-run.sh.

Active run(s):
$OUTPUT

Recommended options:
  1. Read-only exploration is allowed — Read/Grep/Glob/qmd will not be blocked.
  2. For parallel work: create a git worktree in a sibling directory and cd into it.
       git -C <repo> worktree add ../<repo>-wt-<branch> <branch>
     Worktrees that are not registered as owned can be edited freely.
  3. Wait for the owning session to finish. Stale entries auto-clear after the
     heartbeat timeout (default 15 min) or when the owning PID dies.
  4. Emergency bypass (use with caution, logged to workspace/learnings/):
       export HQ_IGNORE_ACTIVE_RUNS=1
     or pass --ignore-active-runs to /run-project.
