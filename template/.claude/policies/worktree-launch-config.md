## Rule

When using git worktrees for project execution:

1. `.claude/launch.json` dev server configs reference the original repo path as `cwd`. A worktree lives at a different path (e.g. `repos/private/{company}-{your-project}-wt-feature-...`). Update `launch.json` `cwd` to the worktree path before starting the dev server.
2. Revert `launch.json` `cwd` back to the main repo path after merging the worktree back.
3. Worktrees do NOT inherit `.env.local` from the main repo. Copy `.env.local` from the main repo root into the worktree root before starting the dev server.

## Examples

**Correct:**
- Before `preview_start` in a worktree: update `launch.json` cwd to the worktree path, copy `.env.local` from main repo
- After merging worktree: revert `launch.json` cwd back to the main repo path

**Incorrect:**
- Running `preview_start` in a worktree without updating `launch.json` — server starts in the wrong directory
- Starting the dev server in a worktree without `.env.local` — crashes at runtime with missing env var errors
