## Rule

When a Next.js 16 app with Turbopack dev mode shows RSC pages stuck on their Suspense fallback ("Loading...") despite the server returning 200, do not debug the issue in dev mode. Run `npm run build` instead and verify the correct page count in build output — a successful production build with the expected page count is the authoritative verification signal.

## Examples

**Correct:**
- App shows "Loading..." on RSC page in dev mode → run `npm run build` → build succeeds with 34 pages → consider it verified, move on

**Incorrect:**
- App shows "Loading..." on RSC page in dev mode → spend time adding `loading.tsx` overrides, changing Suspense boundaries, or re-fetching strategies trying to fix a dev-mode artifact
