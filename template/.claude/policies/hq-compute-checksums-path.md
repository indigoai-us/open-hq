## Rule

The checksum script for HQ Core Governance is at `template/scripts/compute-checksums.sh` (not `scripts/compute-checksums.sh`). Requires `yq` (`brew install yq`). Run from the HQ repo root after modifying locked kernel files. Updates `template/core.yaml` checksums.

The Core Governance CI check **always fails** when locked files are modified — even with valid checksums. This is by design: checksums prove acknowledgment, but maintainer approval is still required to merge.
