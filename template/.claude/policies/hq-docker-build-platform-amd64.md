title: Always build Docker images with --platform linux/amd64 for ECS/EC2

## Rule

ALWAYS use `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64` when building images for ECS/EC2 deployment. Never use plain `docker build` on Apple Silicon Macs for cloud targets — it produces ARM64 images that fail with "exec format error" on x86_64 instances.

Cross-compilation via QEMU emulation takes 5-10x longer than native builds. Use `--push` flag with buildx to combine build+push in one step. Cached layers make subsequent builds fast (~10s for code-only changes).
