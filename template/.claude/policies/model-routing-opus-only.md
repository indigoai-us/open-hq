## Rule

**All Claude work runs on Opus 4.6. Never use Sonnet.**

HQ's value comes from orchestration fidelity — policies, manifest routing, company isolation, hook compliance, knowledge management. Every layer of this system benefits from maximum model quality. There is no task category where downgrading Claude's model is acceptable.

### Model Tiers

| Model | Scope | Examples |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Opus 4.6** | All Claude work — sessions, sub-agents, workers | Architecture, planning, code review, debugging, orchestration, search, execution, drafting, testing |
| **Codex GPT-5.4** | Code gen, review, debug via Codex CLI | `codex exec`, `codex review` — independent second opinion |
| **Gemini** | Gemini CLI workers | Design audit, frontend, CSS, UX — via `gemini` CLI |

### Implementation

- `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=opus` — never change this
- All worker YAMLs: `execution.model: opus` (default, no need to specify)
- Never pass `model: "sonnet"` on Agent tool calls
- Codex workers use `codex_model: gpt-5.4` with `--reasoning high --fast`
- Gemini workers shell out to `gemini` CLI — separate model entirely

### What About Cost?

Opus costs more than Sonnet. This is intentional. The failure modes of a cheaper model in HQ (skipped policy steps, wrong company credentials, missed orchestration rules) cost more in wasted time and broken state than the token savings. Pay for quality everywhere.
