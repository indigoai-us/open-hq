## Rule

`expo-secure-store` only allows keys matching `/^[\w.-]+$/` — letters, digits, underscores, dots, hyphens. **Colons are NOT allowed.** Use dots as namespace separators (e.g. `{company}.auth` not `{company}:auth`).

The error message "Invalid key" appears as an unhandled promise rejection that's easy to miss — it shows briefly in the dev error banner then disappears.

## How to apply

When creating SecureStore keys in any Expo app, always use dots or underscores as separators, never colons.
