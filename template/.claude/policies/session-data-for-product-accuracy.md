## Rule

Before writing user-facing HQ guides or cheatsheets, analyze actual session data in `workspace/threads/` and `workspace/learnings/.observe-patterns*.json` to identify which commands are actually used. The curriculum outline and theoretical command list diverge significantly from real usage. Key discrepancies found: /search and /run {worker} {skill} appear in docs but are rarely used directly; the real loop is /startwork → /brainstorm → /prd → /run-project → /handoff.
