## Rule

NEVER fix a bug by hiding or masking the error. When investigating a failure, always trace to the root cause and fix the actual problem — not just improve how the error is displayed.

Adding error handling UI (retry buttons, better error messages) is necessary but NOT sufficient. If the underlying API/query/service is failing, fix WHY it fails. A "fix" that only improves error presentation while the root cause persists is not a fix.

When debugging:
1. Identify the root cause first
2. Fix the root cause
3. THEN improve error handling/UI as a defense-in-depth measure
