## Rule

ALWAYS use the custom slack-mcp (`repos/public/slack-mcp/`), NEVER the official Slack marketplace plugin. The official plugin uses OAuth bot tokens that cannot access private channels.

When `resolveChannel` fails for a private channel (user token lacks `groups:read`), the search-based fallback discovers the channel ID via `search.messages`. If the MCP server hasn't restarted to pick up this fix, pass the channel ID directly instead of the channel name.

### Known Private Channel IDs ({Product})
