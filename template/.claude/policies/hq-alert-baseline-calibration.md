## Rule

1. **Before setting alert thresholds, document the expected baseline behavior** including known patterns that should NOT trigger alerts. If 51% of a certain event type is expected to lack a particular field, that is not an anomaly — it is the baseline.
2. **Every alert rule must include an "expected exceptions" section** that lists known conditions under which the metric will appear abnormal but is actually healthy. Examples: new brands with no historical data, disconnected accounts, known platform behavior (e.g., Shopify checkout events without identity).
3. **Use percentage-of-baseline thresholds rather than absolute thresholds** when the metric varies by entity (brand, account, region). A brand doing 2 checkouts/day dropping to 1 is noise; a brand doing 200/day dropping to 5 is critical.
4. **Include a warm-up/calibration period for new entities.** New brands, new integrations, and recently reconnected accounts should be excluded from alerts for a defined period (e.g., 7 days) until a stable baseline is established.
5. **When an alert fires and is determined to be a false positive, immediately update the alert rule** to exclude that pattern. Do not dismiss the alert and leave the rule unchanged — it will fire again and erode trust in the monitoring system.
