## Rule

Regression gates in `run-project.sh` MUST compare error counts against a baseBranch baseline. Only fail when errors **increase** beyond the baseline — pre-existing errors on main are not regressions.

The per-story back-pressure (inside `/execute-task`) already handles this correctly by noting "pre-existing errors only, none from this story." The regression gate must match this behavior.

When diagnosing regression gate failures: always verify whether the failing errors also exist on the base branch before treating them as regressions.
