title: Bulk sed with exceptions — run sweep first, fix exceptions last
scope: global
trigger: bulk file edits, sed, find + sed, mass replace with exceptions

## Rule

When doing a bulk `find + sed` sweep across many files with specific exceptions, ALWAYS:
1. Run the bulk sweep first (changes all files)
2. Then fix the exceptions afterwards

NEVER do exceptions first then sweep — the sweep will overwrite the exception changes.

Alternative: Use `find ... -not -path "*exception-pattern*"` to exclude exception files from the sweep.
