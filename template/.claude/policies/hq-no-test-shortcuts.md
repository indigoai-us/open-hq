## Rule

Always fix tests properly — never skip flaky tests, never add `test.skip` as a workaround, never create false positives. When a test fails, investigate root cause and fix it. This applies to unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests equally.

Prohibited shortcuts:
- `test.skip` / `describe.skip` / `xit` / `xdescribe` as a workaround for failures
- Commenting out failing assertions
- Loosening assertions to make tests pass without fixing the underlying issue
- Marking tests as "known flaky" without a root cause fix
