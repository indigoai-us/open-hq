## Rule

The preview_start tool's shell environment does not have fnm (or nvm) in PATH. Commands like `npm`, `npx`, and bare `node` are not found.

When configuring launch.json entries:
1. Use `/opt/homebrew/bin/node` as `runtimeExecutable` (absolute path)
2. Use `node_modules/.bin/{tool}` (e.g. `node_modules/.bin/next`) in `runtimeArgs` instead of `npm run dev`
3. Next.js 16 uses Turbopack by default with no `--no-turbopack` opt-out. If Turbopack panics in dev, there is no webpack fallback — production Vercel builds use a different pipeline and are unaffected.
