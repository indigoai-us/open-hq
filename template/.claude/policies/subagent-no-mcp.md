title: Sub-Agents Lack MCP Server Access
scope: global
trigger: when spawning Task() sub-agents that need external tools
enforcement: hard

## Rule

Sub-agents spawned via Task() don't inherit MCP server connections. Workers needing external tools (Codex, etc.) must use CLI via Bash, not MCP tools declared in worker.yaml.
