## Rule

1. **NEVER send an email without explicit user confirmation of the sending account.** If the user says "send from Indigo" and that account fails, STOP. Do not fall back to another account.
2. **NEVER fall back to a different email account.** If the requested account's auth is broken, report the error and wait. Do not silently switch to personal or any other account.
3. **If auth fails, the ONLY options are:** (a) fix the auth, (b) draft the email text for the user to send manually, or (c) ask the user what to do. Never send from a different account.
4. **Verify the account alias matches the intended sender before every send.** Double-check `account` parameter matches what the user requested.
5. **Test subject line encoding.** Avoid special characters (×, —, etc.) in subject lines when using MCP tools. Use ASCII equivalents (x, -) to prevent UTF-8 encoding issues.
