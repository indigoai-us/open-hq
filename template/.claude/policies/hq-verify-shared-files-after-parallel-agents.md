## Rule

When 3+ parallel agents all edit the same file (e.g., registry.yaml, package.json, INDEX.md), always read the final file after all agents complete and verify: no duplicate entries, consistent formatting, no merge artifacts. Append-only edits to the same section typically succeed, but each agent can't see the others' changes.
