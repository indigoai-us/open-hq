## Rule

1. **NEVER write a catch block that returns null, undefined, empty array, or a success status without logging the error.** Every catch block must either re-throw, log at ERROR level with context, or return an explicit error object that callers can inspect.
2. **NEVER return HTTP 2xx from an endpoint that encountered an error.** If processing failed, return 4xx/5xx. A 204 No Content that hides a failure is a bug, not defensive coding.
3. **ALWAYS check `.error` on Supabase/PostgREST responses before using `.data`.** The client returns `{ data: null, error: {...} }` on failure — not an exception. Treat unchecked `.error` as equivalent to an uncaught exception.
4. **ALWAYS validate webhook payloads explicitly and log rejections.** If a Pydantic model, Zod schema, or manual check rejects a payload, log the rejection reason and the payload identifier (order ID, event type, etc.) at WARN or ERROR level. Silent validation rejection is invisible data loss.
5. **Background jobs and queue handlers MUST log failures with enough context to identify the affected records.** Include entity IDs, event types, and timestamps. A failed `putEvent()` with no log means orphaned records that nobody knows about.
