## Rule

NEVER pull high-volume monitoring data (metrics, health checks, dashboards) inline in the parent session — each tick burns 50K+ tokens of tool results.

Instead:
1. **Recurring runs** → use `mcp__scheduled-tasks__create_scheduled_task` (persistent, isolated session per run)
2. **Ad-hoc "run it now"** → spawn `Agent(run_in_background=true)` to collect data and format the dashboard. Parent receives only the compact summary.

The parent session should only see the final formatted output, never raw query results.
