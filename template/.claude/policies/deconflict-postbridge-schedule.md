## Rule

Before scheduling a batch of posts via Post-Bridge:
1. Query `GET /v1/posts?status=scheduled&limit=100` (paginate if >100) to get ALL existing scheduled posts
2. Map existing posts by date and account ID to identify occupied time slots
3. Schedule new posts only in free slots — avoid same-account same-hour collisions
4. {product} posts go to BOTH accounts ({x-account-id} + {li-account-id}) every 3 days — account for this when scheduling X-only or LinkedIn-only posts
