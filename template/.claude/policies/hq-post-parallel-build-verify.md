title: Build and Typecheck After Parallel Agent Execution
scope: global
trigger: after any parallel/concurrent agent execution that edits code (swarm, sub-agents, worktrees)
enforcement: hard

## Rule

1. **After parallel agents complete, ALWAYS run the project's build and typecheck before reporting success.** This is not optional — parallel agents cannot see each other's changes, so cross-agent integration errors are expected, not exceptional.
2. **Run a comprehensive grep for all removed or renamed identifiers** to verify no stale references remain. Sub-agents consistently miss files outside their assigned scope (schema files, component props, infra configs, re-exports).
3. **Verify import paths in all files created by sub-agents.** Sub-agents get relative import paths wrong when creating files in unfamiliar directory structures (e.g., `../../hooks/` instead of `../hooks/`). Run `bun check` / `tsc --noEmit` / equivalent to catch broken imports before proceeding.
4. **Check for cross-agent file conflicts.** If multiple agents edited the same file, read the final state and verify: no duplicate entries, no merge artifacts, consistent formatting, no lost edits.
5. **If build or typecheck fails, fix all errors before proceeding.** Do not leave broken builds for the user to discover. The orchestrator owns the integration — individual agents own their scope.
