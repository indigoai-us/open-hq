## Rule

Archived projects go to `companies/{co}/projects/_archive/` (NOT central `projects/_archive/`). All company data lives under its company dir. Active projects still in `projects/` will migrate to company dirs over time. Each company's `board.json` is the canonical registry of all work (active + archived).
