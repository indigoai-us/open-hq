## Rule

When spawning sub-agents for Paper MCP design work, agents MUST run sequentially — never in parallel. Paper operates on a single shared canvas; two agents writing HTML nodes simultaneously create overlapping artboards and corrupted layouts.

Parallelism comes in the code build phase (independent file trees), not the design phase (shared canvas).

Effective pattern: Design System agent first (establishes tokens) → Desktop pages agent → Mobile pages agent → QA agent. Each completes and calls `finish_working_on_nodes` before the next starts.
