## Rule

When calling `POST https://api.post-bridge.com/v1/posts` directly (not via SDK), use these exact field names:
- `caption` — the post text (NOT `content`)
- `social_accounts` — array of numeric account IDs, e.g. `[12345]` (NOT `account_id`)
- `scheduled_at` — ISO8601 datetime string

Also: always check for existing scheduled posts before submitting (`GET /v1/posts?status=scheduled`) — duplicate posts from previous sessions may already exist at the same time slots.
