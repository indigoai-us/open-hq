title: Never Grep for PRD or Worker Discovery
scope: global
trigger: when searching for prd.json, worker.yaml, or discovering project/worker files
enforcement: hard
---

## Rule

Never use Grep to find `prd.json`, `worker.yaml`, or discover project/company/worker directories. This is hook-enforced — Grep calls with these patterns are blocked.

**Use instead:**
- **Project PRDs:** `qmd search "{name} prd.json" --json -n 5` → parse results → `Read` the file
- **Workers:** `Read workers/registry.yaml` → find path → `Read {path}/worker.yaml`
- **Companies:** `Read companies/manifest.yaml` — all companies listed there
- **Known exact path:** `Read companies/{co}/projects/{name}/prd.json` directly

Grep is for exact pattern matching in code (e.g. `import.*AuthService` with `glob: "*.ts"`), not for file discovery.
