## Rule

When creating or updating a scheduled task via the scheduled-tasks MCP tools, the system overwrites `SKILL.md` with the `prompt` parameter content. Any detailed reference material (SQL queries, message formats, remediation tables, thresholds) stored directly in SKILL.md will be lost on the next update.

ALWAYS store detailed reference material in a separate `REFERENCE.md` file alongside `SKILL.md` in the same `~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/{taskId}/` directory. The prompt in SKILL.md should instruct the agent to "Read the REFERENCE.md for exact queries and full instructions."
