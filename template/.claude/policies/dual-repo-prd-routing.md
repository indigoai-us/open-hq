## Rule

When a PRD spans two repos (`repoPath` + `secondaryRepoPath`), add a `REPO:` prefix in each story's `notes` field directing the sub-agent to the correct repo. Example: `"REPO: This story targets repos/private/artist-manager (NOT holler-comms). CD to that repo before working."` Also expand `qualityGates` to run typecheck in both repos using subshell: `"(cd /path/to/secondary/repo && npm run typecheck)"`.
