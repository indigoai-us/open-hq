## Rule

Before running `vercel domains add` or assuming a Vercel project is live, verify it actually exists on the team with `vercel project ls --scope {team}`. The deploy registry `live: false` may mean the project was never created on Vercel — not just that it's paused. If the project doesn't exist, run `vercel link --yes` + `vercel --prod` first.
