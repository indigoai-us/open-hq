title: Verify Vercel Framework Detection After Project Creation

## Rule

If Vercel project has `framework: null`, production builds deploy but serve 404 on all routes (even though build succeeds). Two fix methods:

1. **Preferred — `vercel.json` in repo root**: Add `{"framework": "nextjs"}` (or appropriate framework). Committed to repo, survives project recreation, no API calls needed.
2. **Alternative — API patch**: `PATCH /v9/projects/{id}` with `{"framework":"nextjs","installCommand":"pnpm install"}` then redeploy.

Always verify framework is set after project creation. Diagnostic clue: build logs missing "Traced Next.js server files" line despite successful page compilation.
