## Rule

After 10+ conversation turns, or if context compaction has occurred, re-read any file before editing it. Do not trust cached/remembered file contents — compaction may have silently discarded the original read.

Also: after editing a file, read it back to confirm the edit applied correctly. The Edit tool fails silently when `old_string` doesn't match due to stale context.

Do not batch more than 3 edits to the same file without a verification read.
