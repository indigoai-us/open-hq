## Rule

`companies/manifest.yaml` field `vercel_team` and `companies/{co}/projects/{project}/prd.json` field `metadata.vercelTeam` must match byte-for-byte. **If they don't, STOP and reconcile before running any Vercel-scoped operation.**

**Cross-check protocol (mandatory when either field is about to be used):**

1. Read both values:
   ```bash
   manifest_team=$(yq '.companies.{co}.vercel_team' companies/manifest.yaml)
   prd_team=$(jq -r '.metadata.vercelTeam' companies/{co}/projects/{project}/prd.json)
   ```
2. If `"$manifest_team" != "$prd_team"`: ABORT and surface both values to the user.
3. Resolve ground truth against Vercel itself:
   ```bash
   cd repos/{pub|priv}/{repo}
   vercel whoami                  # current scope
   vercel teams ls                # all teams the current user can access
   vercel project ls              # projects scoped to the current team
   ```
4. Update the wrong file — prefer the PRD matching the manifest if the manifest reflects deploy reality. Commit the correction with a `fix(manifest)` or `fix(prd)` message naming both files.
5. Only after the two fields agree, proceed with `gh pr create`, `vercel deploy`, `vercel alias`, etc.

**Don't assume either is right.** The PRD is authored by hand and drifts; the manifest can be outdated from a team rename (e.g. `{company}-brands` renamed to a team ID like `{company}-f0dc7e1b`). Both have been wrong in real incidents.
