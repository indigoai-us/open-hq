## Rule

When using parallel sub-agents to generate creative content (social posts, marketing copy, reformatted text), always run a dedup pass on the combined output. Sub-agents receiving both a "definition" and "body text" for reformatting will repeat the definition inside the body ~11% of the time. Check for any substantial line (>40 chars) appearing more than once per entry and remove duplicates.
