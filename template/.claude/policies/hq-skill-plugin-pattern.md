## Rule

Integrate external Claude Code skill packages as namespaced plugins using the bridge
script pattern:

1. Clone repo to `repos/public/{package}/`
2. Create `scripts/{package}-bridge.sh` — iterate dirs with SKILL.md, symlink each to
   `.claude/skills/{prefix}-{name}/`. Use SKILL.md presence for dynamic discovery (no
   static skill list). Subcommands: install, remove, status, update.
3. Create `.claude/policies/{package}-prefix-mapping.md` — soft-enforcement policy
   remapping internal cross-skill references to prefixed equivalents.
4. Register in `modules/modules.yaml` under Add-On Kits.
5. Optionally create a worker that chains the package's skills.

NEVER copy or fork skill files — symlink for zero-copy upstream updates.
ALWAYS use a short prefix (e.g. `g-`) to avoid collisions with HQ skills.
ALWAYS skip infrastructure dirs (bin/, scripts/, test/) via a skip list.
