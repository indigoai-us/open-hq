## Rule

Removing `@clerk/nextjs` from code + env vars is NOT enough to remove Clerk auth from a Vercel project. Clerk injects middleware at the Vercel edge infrastructure level (visible via `x-clerk-auth-status` and `x-clerk-auth-reason` response headers). Even disabling `ssoProtection`, `vercelAuthentication`, and `passwordProtection` via the Vercel API may not remove it.

**Fastest fix:** Create a new Vercel project without the Clerk integration, copy env vars via the Vercel API, and deploy there.

## How to apply

When migrating away from Clerk on Vercel, budget for creating a new Vercel project rather than trying to strip Clerk from the existing one.
