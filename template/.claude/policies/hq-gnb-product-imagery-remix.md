## Rule

NEVER generate branded product imagery (cans, bottles, packaging) from text descriptions alone. AI image generators consistently produce wrong brand text, colors, and label layouts (e.g. "SPARKLE" instead of "HpO").

ALWAYS use this two-step workflow:
1. Generate the lifestyle scene first (person, setting, lighting) — the product will have wrong branding, that's expected
2. Use `gnb remix <lifestyle-photo> "<prompt to replace product>"` with detailed description of the actual product appearance to fix the branding

Reference actual product photos from `companies/{co}/data/product-images/` or `companies/{co}/data/design-files/renders/` for accurate brand details in the remix prompt.
