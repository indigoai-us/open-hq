## Rule

1. **Every PR must address exactly one concern.** A concern is: one bug fix, one feature, one refactor, one infrastructure change, or one dependency update. If you cannot describe the PR in a single sentence without "and," it likely contains multiple concerns.
2. **Before creating a PR, review the diff for unrelated changes.** If the diff includes changes to files or systems unrelated to the stated goal, split them into separate PRs.
3. **Work-in-progress code for a different feature must not ride along in another PR.** If a branch contains partial work on feature B while primarily implementing feature A, revert or stash the feature B changes before opening the PR.
4. **Infrastructure changes (configs, dependencies, CI, migrations) must ship separately from feature code** unless the feature strictly requires the infrastructure change to function. If they can be deployed independently, they must be PRed independently.
5. **If you realize mid-PR that the scope has expanded, stop and split.** Create a stacked PR or separate branches rather than continuing to add to a growing PR.
