# Execute Task - Worker-Coordinated Story Execution

Execute a single user story from a PRD through coordinated worker phases. Each worker handles their domain and passes context to the next via structured handoffs. Back pressure (typecheck, lint, tests) enforces correctness at every phase.

**Usage:** `execute-task {project}/{task-id}`

**User's input:** `$ARGUMENTS`

## Ralph Principle

"Pick a task, complete it, commit it."

- Fresh context per task
- Sub-agents do heavy lifting (spawned via Task tool)
- Back pressure keeps code on rails
- Handoffs preserve context between workers
- Each sub-agent commits its own work before returning

## Process

### 1. Parse Arguments

Extract `{project}/{task-id}` from `$ARGUMENTS`.

Split on `/`: first token is `project`, second is `task-id`.

If no arguments or missing parts:

```
Usage: /execute-task {project}/{task-id}

Example: /execute-task campaign-migration/CAM-003
```

Stop here.

### 2. Load Task Spec

Resolve project location using `qmd search` (never Glob for `prd.json`):

```bash
qmd search "{project} prd.json" --json -n 5
```

From results, find the entry whose path includes `/{project}/prd.json`. If qmd is unavailable or returns nothing, fall back to direct Read at these paths in order:

1. `companies/{co}/projects/{project}/prd.json` (company projects)
2. `projects/{project}/prd.json` (personal/HQ projects)

If no `prd.json` found:

```
ERROR: prd.json not found for {project}. Run /prd {project} first.
```

Stop.

Read `prd.json`. Validate structure strictly — no fallbacks:

1. **userStories array required**: If `userStories` is missing or not an array:
   ```
   ERROR: prd.json missing userStories array. Migrate legacy 'features' key to 'userStories'.
   ```
   Stop.

2. **Required fields per story**: Each story must have `id`, `title`, `description`, `passes`. Report any story with missing fields and stop.

3. **Find the target story**: Match `task-id` against `story.id`. If not found:
   ```
   Task {task-id} not found in {project} prd.json.
   ```
   Stop.

4. **Check completion**: If `story.passes === true`:
   ```
   Task {task-id} already complete (passes: true). Skipping.
   ```
   Stop.

5. **Check dependencies**: If the story has `dependsOn`, verify each dependency story has `passes: true`. If any dependency is incomplete:
   ```
   Task {task-id} blocked: depends on {dep-id} which is not yet complete.
   ```
   Stop.

Extract from the matched story:

- `id`, `title`, `description`
- `acceptance_criteria` (or `acceptanceCriteria`)
- `files` (for file locking)
- `dependsOn` (already checked)
- `e2eTests` (for acceptance-test-writer phase)
- `worker_hints` (optional worker inclusion)
- `model_hint` (story-level model override)
- `codex_model_hint` (Codex CLI model override)
- `linearIssueId` (for Linear sync)

Also record from `prd.metadata`:

- `company` — active company slug
- `repoPath` — target repo path
- `linearCredentials`, `linearInProgressStateId`, `linearDoneStateId`, `linearReviewers`
- `qualityGates` — custom quality gate commands
- `docsPath` — documentation location

### 2.5 Check Codex CLI Availability

For any code-related task type, pre-flight check whether the Codex CLI is installed:

```bash
which codex >/dev/null 2>&1
```

- If available: set `codex_available = true`
- If unavailable: set `codex_available = false`, warn:
  ```
  Warning: Codex CLI not found. codex-reviewer will run as Claude-only review (no Codex model).
  ```

This enables graceful degradation — the pipeline continues without Codex but logs a warning.

### 2.6 Check Story Checkout State

Guard against concurrent execution of the same story.

1. **Load config**: Read `settings/orchestrator.yaml` → `checkout.enabled` and `checkout.stale_timeout_minutes` (defaults: `true`, `30`).
2. **Skip if disabled**: If `checkout.enabled: false`, skip this step entirely and proceed to step 3.
3. **Read state.json**: Read `workspace/orchestrator/{project}/state.json`. If missing, skip — no checkout to check.
4. **Check for existing checkout**: If `current_task.id` matches this story AND `current_task.checkedOutBy` is not null:

   a. Extract checkout info:
   ```
   checkedOutPid = state.current_task.checkedOutBy.pid
   checkedOutSession = state.current_task.checkedOutBy.sessionId
   checkedOutAt = state.current_task.checkedOutBy.startedAt
   ```

   b. Check if PID is alive:
   ```bash
   kill -0 {checkedOutPid} 2>/dev/null
   ```

   c. **If PID is ALIVE** — ask the user via AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   Story {task.id} is currently checked out by PID {checkedOutPid}
   (session: {checkedOutSession}, started: {checkedOutAt}).
   Another /execute-task may be running.
   Proceed anyway (override) or abort?
   Options: ["Proceed anyway", "Abort"]
   ```
   - If user chooses **Abort**: stop immediately
   - If user chooses **Proceed anyway**: log warning and continue

   d. **If PID is DEAD** — release the stale checkout:
   - If `checkedOutAt` is null/empty: release unconditionally. Set `current_task.checkedOutBy = null`, update `updated_at`. Warn "Released checkout held by dead PID {checkedOutPid} (no timestamp)". Proceed normally.
   - If `checkedOutAt` is present: compute age = `now() - Date.parse(checkedOutAt)`. Dead PID = safe to take over regardless. Set `current_task.checkedOutBy = null`, update `updated_at`. Warn with age vs `stale_timeout_minutes * 60`. Proceed normally.

5. **If no conflict**: proceed normally.

Report:
```
Checkout check: clear (no active checkout for {task.id})
```
or after release:
```
Checkout check: released dead checkout for {task.id}, proceeding
```

### 3. Classify Task Type

Analyze the story's title, description, and acceptance criteria. Match against patterns:

| Type | Indicators |
|------|------------|
| `schema_change` | database, migration, schema, table, column, prisma, SQL |
| `api_development` | endpoint, API, REST, GraphQL, route, service |
| `ui_component` | component, page, form, button, React, UI, responsive |
| `full_stack` | Combination of backend + frontend indicators |
| `codex_fullstack` | codex, AI-generated, codex-powered full stack |
| `enhancement` | animation, polish, refactor, optimization, UX |
| `content` | copy, content, documentation, marketing text |

**Codex worker routing:**

- **codex-reviewer** is **mandatory** for all code task types (schema_change, api_development, ui_component, full_stack, codex_fullstack, enhancement). Always included after code-reviewer.
- **codex-coder** and **codex-debugger** remain optional — included when `worker_hints` or task indicators match:

| Pattern | Worker | Inclusion |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| "codex", "AI-generated" | codex-coder | Optional (hints match) |
| "auto-fix", "debug recovery" | codex-debugger | Optional (hints match) |

Report classification:

```
Task: {task.id} - {task.title}
Type: {type} (matched: {indicators})
```

### 4. Select Worker Sequence

Based on task type, determine the worker sequence:

```yaml
schema_change:
  - product-planner (if spec unclear)
  - database-dev
  - backend-dev
  - acceptance-test-writer (if e2eTests non-empty)
  - code-reviewer
  - codex-reviewer
  - dev-qa-tester

api_development:
  - product-planner (if spec unclear)
  - backend-dev
  - codex-coder (optional, if worker_hints include codex)
  - acceptance-test-writer (if e2eTests non-empty)
  - code-reviewer
  - codex-reviewer
  - codex-debugger (optional, before QA if back-pressure issues)
  - dev-qa-tester

ui_component:
  - product-planner (if spec unclear)
  - frontend-dev
  - codex-coder (optional, if worker_hints include codex)
  - motion-designer
  - acceptance-test-writer (if e2eTests non-empty)
  - code-reviewer
  - codex-reviewer
  - codex-debugger (optional, before QA if back-pressure issues)
  - dev-qa-tester

full_stack:
  - product-planner
  - architect
  - database-dev
  - backend-dev
  - frontend-dev
  - codex-coder (optional, if worker_hints include codex)
  - acceptance-test-writer (if e2eTests non-empty)
  - code-reviewer
  - codex-reviewer
  - codex-debugger (optional, before QA if back-pressure issues)
  - dev-qa-tester

codex_fullstack:
  - product-planner (if spec unclear)
  - architect
  - database-dev
  - codex-coder
  - acceptance-test-writer (if e2eTests non-empty)
  - codex-reviewer
  - dev-qa-tester

content:
  - content-brand
  - content-product
  - content-sales
  - content-legal

enhancement:
  - (relevant dev based on files)
  - acceptance-test-writer (if e2eTests non-empty)
  - code-reviewer
  - codex-reviewer
  - codex-debugger (optional, if auto-fix needed)
```

**Sequence rules:**

- **Skip product-planner** if the story already has detailed acceptance criteria.
- **Skip acceptance-test-writer** if `e2eTests` is empty or absent.
- **Filter by active workers** — check `workers/registry.yaml` and skip any worker whose `status` is not `active`.

**Worker phase descriptions** (for execution plan display):

| Worker | Phase Description |
|--------|-------------------|
| product-planner | Clarify spec and acceptance criteria |
| architect | Design system architecture |
| database-dev | Implement schema and migrations |
| backend-dev | Implement backend service |
| frontend-dev | Implement frontend UI |
| codex-coder | Generate code via Codex AI |
| motion-designer | Add animations and motion |
| code-reviewer | Review changes (Claude-based) |
| codex-reviewer | Mandatory second-opinion review via Codex AI |
| acceptance-test-writer | Write story-level acceptance tests from e2eTests |
| codex-debugger | Auto-fix issues via Codex AI |
| dev-qa-tester | Verify implementation |
| content-brand | Brand-aligned content creation |
| content-product | Product content and documentation |

Present the execution plan:

```
Execution Plan for {task.id}:

Phase 1: {worker} -> {phase description}
Phase 2: {worker} -> {phase description}
Phase 3: {worker} -> {phase description}

Phases: {N} | Type: {type}
Proceed? [Y/n]
```

### 5. Initialize Execution State

Create the execution tracking directory and file:

```bash
mkdir -p workspace/orchestrator/{project}/executions
```

Write to `workspace/orchestrator/{project}/executions/{task-id}.json`:

```json
{
  "task_id": "{task.id}",
  "project": "{project}",
  "started_at": "{ISO8601}",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "current_phase": 1,
  "phases": [
    {"worker": "{worker1}", "status": "pending"},
    {"worker": "{worker2}", "status": "pending"}
  ],
  "handoffs": [],
  "codex_debug_attempts": []
}
```

### 5.0.5 Acquire Story Checkout

If `checkout.enabled: true` (from `settings/orchestrator.yaml`):

1. **Read state.json**: Read `workspace/orchestrator/{project}/state.json`. If missing, create with minimal structure: `{"version":1,"current_task":{},"updated_at":"{ISO8601}"}`.

2. **Write checkout entry** into `current_task.checkedOutBy`:
   ```json
   {
     "pid": {current_process_pid},
     "startedAt": "{ISO8601}",
     "sessionId": "{started_at from step 5}"
   }
   ```
   Also ensure `current_task.id` is set to this story's ID and `updated_at` is refreshed.

   **Getting the PID**: Run `echo $$` in bash to get the current shell's PID. Use that value as the `pid` field.

3. **Write state.json back** with the updated `checkedOutBy` block.

4. Report: `Checkout acquired for {task.id} (PID: {pid})`

If `checkout.enabled: false`: skip this step silently.

### 5.1 Audit: Task Started

```bash
scripts/audit-log.sh append \
  --event task_started \
  --project {project} \
  --story-id {task.id} \
  --company {company} \
  --session-id {started_at} \
  --action "Task execution started: {task.title}" || true
```

### 5.5 Acquire File Locks

If the story has a non-empty `files` array and prd metadata has `repoPath`:

1. **Load config**: Read `settings/orchestrator.yaml` → `file_locking`.
2. **Skip if disabled**: If `file_locking.enabled: false`, skip this step entirely.
3. **Read existing locks**: Read `{repoPath}/.file-locks.json` (create if missing: `{"version":1,"locks":[]}`).
4. **Stale lock cleanup**: For each existing lock, check if owner PID is running via `kill -0 {pid} 2>/dev/null`. If not running AND lock is older than `stale_lock_timeout_minutes`, remove it.
5. **Conflict check**: For each file in `task.files`:
   - **Self-owned lock**: If already locked by the SAME story ID, skip it (orchestrator may have pre-acquired locks for swarm mode).
   - **Conflict with DIFFERENT story**: Apply `conflict_mode` from config:
     - `hard_block`: STOP — report conflicting files + owner story, exit with `{"status":"blocked","blocked_by":[...]}`
     - `soft_block`: Log warning, proceed but add `locked_files` to worker context so workers skip them
     - `read_only_fallback`: Log warning, proceed with `read_only_files` in worker context
6. **Acquire locks**: For each unlocked file, append to `.file-locks.json`:
   ```json
   {"file": "{path}", "owner": {"project": "{project}", "story": "{task.id}", "pid": {$$}}, "acquired_at": "{ISO8601}"}
   ```
   (Get PID via `echo $$` in bash.)
7. **Update state.json**: Update project's `checkedOutFiles`:
   ```json
   [{"file": "{path}", "story": "{task.id}", "repo": "{repoPath}"}]
   ```

Report: `File locks acquired: {N} files for {task.id}`

### 5.5.5 Sync Linear Issue to In Progress (Best-Effort)

If the story has `linearIssueId` and prd metadata has `linearCredentials`:

1. **Cross-company guard**: Before using `linearCredentials`, verify the path matches the active company per `companies/manifest.yaml`. If it points to a different company's settings, ABORT Linear sync and warn.

2. **Read API key**:
   ```bash
   LINEAR_KEY=$(cat {prd.metadata.linearCredentials} | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['apiKey'])")
   ISSUE_ID="{task.linearIssueId}"
   IN_PROGRESS_STATE="{prd.metadata.linearInProgressStateId}"
   ```

3. **Set issue to In Progress**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: $LINEAR_KEY" \
     -d "{\"query\": \"mutation { issueUpdate(id: \\\"$ISSUE_ID\\\", input: { stateId: \\\"$IN_PROGRESS_STATE\\\" }) { success } }\"}"
   ```

4. **Comment on issue**: "Started by HQ — task in progress."

Skip silently if no `linearIssueId` or no credentials configured. Never block execution on Linear sync failure.

### 5.6 Load Applicable Policies

Load policies via frontmatter-only gate. Use `bash scripts/read-policy-frontmatter.sh {file}` for each policy file — this reads frontmatter only (not full body), keeping context lean.

1. **Company policies**: Determine the active company from `prd.metadata.company` or manifest repo lookup. Read frontmatter for each file in `companies/{co}/policies/` (skip `example-policy.md`). For any policy with `enforcement: hard` whose `trigger` matches the current task, additionally read its `## Rule` section via targeted Read + range.

2. **Repo policies**: If working inside a repo, check `{repoPath}/.claude/policies/` if it exists. Same frontmatter-only pattern.

3. **Global policies**: Prefer the compiled digest at `.claude/policies/_digest.md` if present (auto-loaded by SessionStart hook). If no digest, filter policies in `.claude/policies/` by `trigger` — don't load all.

Include applicable policy rules in worker prompts (step 6b) under `### Applicable Policies`.

**Enforcement distinction:**

- **Hard enforcement** policies are absolute constraints — workers must not violate them.
- **Soft enforcement** policies allow deviation but require logging.

### 6. Execute Each Phase

For each worker in the sequence, spawn a sub-agent via the Task tool. Each sub-agent runs in its own isolated context window, commits its work before returning, and passes a structured handoff forward.

#### 6a. Load Worker Config

1. Read `workers/registry.yaml` to find the worker path:
   ```bash
   grep -A 4 "  - id: {worker-id}$" workers/registry.yaml | grep "path:"
   ```
   Extract the `path:` value. This may resolve to `workers/public/dev-team/{worker-id}/`, `workers/public/{worker-id}/`, or `companies/{co}/workers/{worker-id}/`.

2. Read `{worker_path}/worker.yaml` to get:
   - `instructions` — worker's role, process, and accumulated learnings
   - `context.base` — files the worker always needs
   - `skills.installed` — worker's skills
   - `verification.post_execute` — back-pressure commands
   - `execution.model` — model tier for this worker (opus/sonnet/haiku)
   - `execution.codex_model` — OpenAI model for Codex CLI invocations (codex workers only)

3. **Resolve model for this phase**:
   ```
   model = task.model_hint || worker.execution.model || "opus"
   ```
   Story-level `model_hint` (from prd.json) overrides worker default. Fallback: opus.

4. **Resolve Codex model** (for codex workers only):
   ```
   codex_model = task.codex_model_hint || worker.execution.codex_model || "gpt-5.4"
   ```
   Story-level `codex_model_hint` overrides worker default. Fallback: gpt-5.4.

5. If the worker has a skill file relevant to the task, note its path so the sub-agent prompt can reference it.

#### 6b. Build Worker Prompt

Construct the sub-agent prompt as a single markdown block:

```markdown
## You are: {worker.name}
## Task: {task.id} - {task.title}

### Description
{task.description}

### Acceptance Criteria
{task.acceptance_criteria as checklist}

### Files to Focus On
{task.files or inferred from description}

### Context from Previous Phase
{handoff_context from previous worker, if any}

### Codebase Exploration
If the target repo has a qmd collection (check `qmd status`), prefer `qmd vsearch "<concept>" -c {collection} --json -n 10` for conceptual search (e.g. "where is auth handled", "billing service pattern"). Use Grep only for exact pattern matching (specific imports, function references, string literals).

### Applicable Policies
{policies loaded in step 5.6, if any}

### Codex CLI Model (codex workers only)
{worker.execution.codex_model || "gpt-5.4"} — pass via `-c model="{codex_model}"` to all codex exec/review commands

### Your Instructions
{worker.instructions}

### Back Pressure (Run Before Completing)
{worker.verification.post_execute commands}

# Repo-specific back-pressure checks may be added here if needed
# e.g. coverage checks, manifest freshness, etc.

### Commit Your Work
Before returning, stage and commit the files you created or modified with a
descriptive message referencing {task.id}. The orchestrator verifies no
uncommitted changes remain after your return — if it finds any, it will
commit them on your behalf and flag you as non-compliant.

### Output Requirements
When complete, provide JSON:
{
  "summary": "What you accomplished",
  "files_created": ["paths"],
  "files_modified": ["paths"],
  "key_decisions": ["decision and rationale"],
  "context_for_next": "Instructions for next worker",
  "back_pressure": {
    "tests": "pass|fail",
    "lint": "pass|fail",
    "typecheck": "pass|fail",
    "build": "pass|fail"
  },
  "issues": ["any blocking issues"]
}
```

#### 6c. Spawn Worker Sub-Agent

Use the Task tool:

```
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: {resolved model from 6a},
  prompt: {built prompt above},
  description: "{worker.id} for {task.id}"
})
```

Each sub-agent runs in its own context window and returns structured JSON output.

#### 6c.5 Inline Codex Review (when worker == codex-reviewer)

**Instead of spawning a sub-agent** for codex-reviewer, run the Codex review directly via CLI. This is deterministic — cannot be skipped by sub-agent discretion.

**If `codex_available == true`:**

1. Collect `files_modified` + `context_for_next` from the previous worker's handoff (code-reviewer).
2. Run Codex CLI review:
   ```bash
   cd {target_repo} && codex review --uncommitted -c model="{codex_model}" \
     "Review changed files for: security, correctness, performance, style. Focus: {context_for_next from code-reviewer}" 2>&1
   ```
3. Capture full output (markdown-formatted review).
4. If output contains "critical" or "high" severity findings:
   - Present findings to the user via AskUserQuestion
   - Options: "Address findings before continuing" / "Continue to QA (findings noted)" / "Skip"
5. Build handoff context from Codex output (add review findings to `context_for_next`).
6. Log to model-usage.jsonl: `{"worker":"codex-reviewer","model":"codex-cli"}`.
7. Continue to next phase (dev-qa-tester).

**If `codex_available == false`:**

- Log warning: `codex-reviewer skipped: CLI not available`
- Continue to next phase without Codex review.
- Still log to model-usage.jsonl: `{"worker":"codex-reviewer","model":"skipped"}`.

**Skip this step entirely** for non-codex-reviewer workers — they spawn normally via 6c.

When iterating through the worker sequence in step 6, check if the current worker is `codex-reviewer`:

- If yes → execute 6c.5 inline, then jump to 6e (skip 6c and 6d for this phase)
- If no → proceed with normal 6c → 6d flow

#### 6c.7 Acceptance Test Writer (when worker == acceptance-test-writer)

**Purpose:** Write executable acceptance tests from the story's `e2eTests` descriptions. These tests persist across stories — when story N+1 runs the full test suite, story N's acceptance tests act as regression guards.

**Skip conditions** (do NOT add this worker to the sequence if any are true):

- `task.e2eTests` is empty, absent, or `[]`
- Task type is `content`

**When this worker runs:**

1. **Read `task.e2eTests`** from prd.json — array of test descriptions.
2. **Read all existing story test files** in `{repo}/__tests__/stories/` to understand the established pattern (imports, helpers, framework).
3. **Detect test framework**: Check `package.json` for vitest/jest/bun test. Check `qualityGates` for test runner command. Fall back to `bun test`.
4. **Spawn sub-agent** with this prompt:

```markdown
## You are: acceptance-test-writer
## Task: Write acceptance tests for {task.id} - {task.title}

### Test Descriptions (from PRD)
{task.e2eTests as numbered list}

### Acceptance Criteria
{task.acceptanceCriteria as checklist}

### Context from Previous Phase
{handoff_context — what was implemented and where}

### Test Convention
- Write tests to: `{repo}/__tests__/stories/{task.id}.test.ts`
- One `describe("{task.id}: {task.title}")` block per story
- One `it()` or `test()` per e2eTests entry
- Import from the actual implementation — use real modules, not mocks
- Tests must verify the BEHAVIOR described in e2eTests, not implementation details
- Tests must be deterministic and fast (no network calls, no timers)
- If the story involves API endpoints: test request/response contracts
- If the story involves UI: test component rendering + user interactions
- If the story involves data: test transformations and edge cases

### Existing Story Tests (follow this pattern)
{contents of existing __tests__/stories/*.test.ts files, if any}

### Test Framework
{detected framework: vitest | jest | bun:test}

### Back Pressure
After writing tests, run them:
{test runner command, e.g. "bun test __tests__/stories/{task.id}.test.ts"}

All tests MUST pass before this phase completes. If a test fails, fix the test
(if the test is wrong) or flag the issue (if the implementation is wrong).

Also run ALL existing story tests to verify no regressions:
{test runner command, e.g. "bun test __tests__/stories/"}

### Output Requirements
{
  "summary": "Tests written for {task.id}",
  "files_created": ["__tests__/stories/{task.id}.test.ts"],
  "files_modified": [],
  "test_count": N,
  "all_story_tests_pass": true|false,
  "context_for_next": "Acceptance tests added: {N} tests in __tests__/stories/{task.id}.test.ts",
  "back_pressure": { "tests": "pass|fail" },
  "issues": []
}
```

5. **Process output**: If `all_story_tests_pass` is false, this is a regression — the current story broke a prior story's behavior. Handle like a back-pressure failure (6d auto-recovery flow).
6. **Continue to code-reviewer** with the test files included in the review scope.

**Key principle:** The test-writer runs AFTER implementation but BEFORE review. Tests validate the implementation against the spec. If they fail, the implementation is wrong — not the tests.

#### 6d. Process Worker Output

Parse the worker's JSON output.

**If back pressure failed:**

1. **Auto-recover via codex-debugger** (max 1 attempt per phase):
   - Check `codex_debug_attempts` — skip if this phase already had a codex-debugger intervention.
   - **If `codex_available == true`:** Run Codex debugger inline via CLI:
     ```bash
     cd {target_repo_path} && codex exec --full-auto -c model="{codex_model}" --cd {target_repo_path} \
       "Diagnose and fix back-pressure failure. Check: {failed_check_name}. Error: {stdout_stderr_from_failed_check}. Then re-run: {verification.post_execute commands}" 2>&1
     ```
   - **If `codex_available == false`:** Spawn Claude-based debugger sub-agent:
     ```
     Task({
       subagent_type: "general-purpose",
       model: "haiku",
       prompt: "You are: codex-debugger\n
         Issue: Back-pressure failure in {worker} phase: {failed_check_name}\n
         Error output: {stdout_stderr_from_failed_check}\n
         cwd: {target_repo_path}\n
         Run debug-issue skill: diagnose root cause, apply fix, then re-run back-pressure checks ({verification.post_execute commands}).",
       description: "codex-debugger recovery for {task.id} phase {N}"
     })
     ```
   - Record the attempt in `codex_debug_attempts`:
     ```json
     { "phase": N, "worker": "{worker}", "check": "{failed_check}", "timestamp": "ISO8601" }
     ```

2. **Re-run back-pressure checks** after codex-debugger completes.
3. If they pass → mark phase completed, continue pipeline (skip normal retry).
4. If they still fail → fall back to normal retry (retry once with error context).
5. If the retry also fails → pause and report.

**If success:**

- Store handoff context
- Update execution state
- Continue to next phase

#### 6d.5 Expand File Locks (Dynamic)

If file locking is enabled and worker output contains `files_created` or `files_modified`:

1. Compute `new_files` = files in worker output NOT already in `.file-locks.json` for this story.
2. If `new_files` is non-empty: acquire locks for them (same as step 5.5 item 6) — append to `.file-locks.json` and state.json `checkedOutFiles`.
3. Also update the story's `files` array in prd.json with the new paths (so future sessions know the full scope).

This ensures stories that touch more files than predicted still get proper lock coverage.

#### 6e. Update Execution State

After each phase, update `workspace/orchestrator/{project}/executions/{task-id}.json`:

```json
{
  "phases": [
    {"worker": "backend-dev", "model": "opus", "status": "completed", "completed_at": "{ISO8601}"},
    {"worker": "code-reviewer", "model": "sonnet", "status": "in_progress"}
  ],
  "handoffs": [
    {
      "from": "backend-dev",
      "to": "code-reviewer",
      "context": {
        "summary": "...",
        "files_created": [],
        "files_modified": [],
        "key_decisions": [],
        "context_for_next": "..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 6e.5 Audit: Phase Completed

```bash
scripts/audit-log.sh append \
  --event phase_completed \
  --project {project} \
  --story-id {task.id} \
  --worker {worker.id} \
  --model {resolved_model} \
  --result {success|fail} \
  --duration-ms {phase_duration_ms} \
  --action "Phase {N} completed: {worker.id}" || true
```

#### 6e.7 Verify Sub-Agent Committed Its Work

After each sub-agent returns, check for uncommitted changes in the target repo:

```bash
cd {target_repo_path} && git status --porcelain
```

If there are uncommitted changes:

1. The sub-agent failed to commit — flag it as non-compliant in `codex_debug_attempts` or a similar log.
2. Stage the files from `files_created` + `files_modified` and commit them with message: `{task.id}: {worker.id} auto-commit (sub-agent did not commit)`.
3. Log a warning — this indicates a worker instruction bug that should be fixed.

This enforces the HQ sub-agent rule: each sub-agent MUST commit its own work before completing. The orchestrator is the safety net.

#### 6f. Log Model Usage

<!-- Schema (all fields):
  ts         string (ISO8601)  — timestamp of the log entry
  project    string            — project slug (from prd.json metadata.name or directory name)
  task       string            — story/task ID (e.g. "US-002")
  worker     string            — worker ID (e.g. "backend-dev")
  model      string            — resolved model name (e.g. "sonnet", "opus")
  phase      number            — execution phase number (1-based)
  company    string (required) — company slug resolved from prd.metadata.company; if absent,
                                 look up manifest.yaml entry matching the project's directory path
  session_id string (optional) — ISO8601 timestamp of task start, taken from started_at
                                 recorded in the execution state (step 5); omit if unavailable
-->

Append one line per phase to `workspace/metrics/model-usage.jsonl`:

```json
{"ts":"ISO8601","project":"{project}","task":"{task.id}","worker":"{worker.id}","model":"{resolved model}","phase":N,"company":"{company}","session_id":"{session_id}"}
```

**Resolving `company`:** Use `prd.metadata.company` if present. Otherwise find the company by matching the project's path (`companies/{co}/projects/…`) against `companies/manifest.yaml` — use the matching `{co}` slug.

**Resolving `session_id`:** Use the `started_at` ISO8601 value written to the execution state in step 5. If no `started_at` is available, omit the field entirely.

**Backward compatibility:** Existing entries that lack `company` or `session_id` remain valid — parsers must treat both fields as optional when reading historical data.

Create `workspace/metrics/` if it doesn't exist. This is append-only — no reads during execution.

#### 6g. Repeat for Next Worker

Advance `current_phase` and repeat from 6a for the next worker in the sequence.

### 7. Complete Task

When all phases complete successfully:

#### 7.0 Release File Locks and Checkout

If file locking is enabled and locks were acquired in step 5.5:

1. Read `{repoPath}/.file-locks.json`.
2. Remove all entries where `owner.project === "{project}" && owner.story === "{task.id}"`.
3. Write updated `.file-locks.json`.
4. Read orchestrator state.json, remove matching entries from project's `checkedOutFiles`.
5. Write state.json.

**Release story checkout** (if `checkout.enabled: true`):

1. Read `workspace/orchestrator/{project}/state.json`.
2. **Safety check**: Only release if the current session holds the checkout — verify `current_task.checkedOutBy.pid` matches the PID acquired in step 5.0.5.
3. If it matches: set `current_task.checkedOutBy = null`, update `updated_at`, write state.json back.
4. If it does NOT match (another session took over): log warning "Checkout held by different PID — not releasing" and skip.
5. Report: `Checkout released for {task.id}`

This entire step runs BEFORE PRD update so locks and checkout are released even if later steps fail.

#### 7a. Update PRD

Determine invocation mode:

- **Standalone (interactive)**: Write `passes: true` directly on the story in prd.json.
- **Invoked by orchestrator** (prompt contains "Do NOT write passes to prd.json"): Skip this write. The orchestrator reads execution output and writes passes itself.

```javascript
// Only if NOT invoked by orchestrator:
// Update resolved prd.json (at companies/{co}/projects/{project}/prd.json)
task.passes = true

// If invoked by orchestrator: skip this write. Output status JSON instead.
// The orchestrator reads your output.json and writes passes itself.
```

Sub-agents may only update the current story's `passes`, `notes`, and `linearIssueId` fields. Never restructure, rename, add, or remove stories.

#### 7a.3 Run Quality Gates

Before marking `passes: true`, run any custom quality gates from `prd.metadata.qualityGates`:

```yaml
qualityGates:
  - "bun typecheck"
  - "bun lint"
  - "bun test"
  - "bun run build"
```

Run each command in the target repo. If any fail, do NOT mark the story complete — fall through to the failure path in step 8.

#### 7a.5 Sync to Linear (if configured)

If the story has `linearIssueId` and prd metadata has `linearCredentials`:

1. **Cross-company guard**: Same validation as step 5.5.5.
2. **Set issue to Done**:
   ```bash
   LINEAR_KEY=$(cat {prd.metadata.linearCredentials} | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['apiKey'])")
   ISSUE_ID="{task.linearIssueId}"
   DONE_STATE="{prd.metadata.linearDoneStateId}"

   curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: $LINEAR_KEY" \
     -d "{\"query\": \"mutation { issueUpdate(id: \\\"$ISSUE_ID\\\", input: { stateId: \\\"$DONE_STATE\\\" }) { success } }\"}"
   ```

Skip silently if no `linearIssueId` on the story or no credentials configured. Linear sync is best-effort — never block task completion on it.

#### 7a.6 Comment on Linear Issue (if configured)

After the state sync, add a comment to the Linear issue:

```bash
COMMENT="Completed by HQ. Ready for review."

# If prd.metadata has linearReviewers (member keys from config.json members block),
# look up member name from config.json and append @mention:
# e.g. "Completed by HQ. Ready for review. cc @{reviewer-name}"

curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: $LINEAR_KEY" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"mutation { commentCreate(input: { issueId: \\\"$ISSUE_ID\\\", body: \\\"$COMMENT\\\" }) { success } }\"}"
```

When a task is blocked or needs resolution, comment with blocker context + @mention the relevant team member. Skip silently if not configured.

#### 7b. Update Documentation

If the task introduced new features, changed behavior, or modified APIs, update the project's user-facing docs.

**Step 1: Resolve docs location**

Check PRD metadata for `docsPath`:

```javascript
const docsPath = prd.metadata?.docsPath
```

If `docsPath` is set, use it. If not, ask the user via AskUserQuestion:

```
This task changed functionality. Where do docs live for this project?
(e.g., src/app/docs/, docs/, README.md, or "none")
```

Save the answer back to `prd.metadata.docsPath` so future tasks skip this question.

**Step 2: Identify what needs updating**

Based on `files_modified`, `files_created`, and `key_decisions` from worker outputs:

- New API endpoints → update relevant API docs
- New UI pages/features → update or create feature docs
- Changed behavior → update existing docs that describe the old behavior
- New database tables/fields → update data model docs if they exist

**Step 3: Apply updates**

Read the existing doc files, match the project's doc format/conventions, and edit in place. For new features with no existing doc page, create one following the project's doc conventions.

**Skip this step** if:

- `docsPath` is "none"
- The task was purely a bug fix with no behavior change
- The task was a refactor with no user-facing impact

#### 7b.5 Capture Learnings via /learn

Run `/learn` with structured input from execution:

```json
{
  "task_id": "{task.id}",
  "project": "{project}",
  "source": "task-completion",
  "severity": "medium",
  "scope": "auto",
  "workers_used": ["list of workers that ran"],
  "back_pressure_failures": [{"worker": "...", "check": "...", "error": "..."}],
  "retries": N,
  "key_decisions": ["aggregated from worker outputs"],
  "issues_encountered": ["from worker outputs"],
  "patterns_discovered": ["success patterns worth preserving"]
}
```

`/learn` handles: policy file creation, event logging, dedup.

If task completed cleanly with no failures/retries/notable patterns, `/learn` will log the event only (no policy created).

#### 7b.6 Reindex

Run: `qmd update 2>/dev/null || true`

Ensures any knowledge, worker instructions, or command rules modified during execution are immediately searchable.

#### 7b.7 Document Release (standalone only)

When invoked standalone (not by `/run-project`), run `/document-release {company} {project}`. Skip when invoked as a sub-agent — the orchestrator runs it in its own completion flow.

Best-effort — never block task completion. Log and continue on failure.

#### 7c.0 Audit: Task Completed

```bash
scripts/audit-log.sh append \
  --event task_completed \
  --project {project} \
  --story-id {task.id} \
  --company {company} \
  --session-id {started_at} \
  --files "{comma_separated_files_touched}" \
  --duration-ms {total_duration_ms} \
  --action "Task completed: {total_phases} phases, {files_touched_count} files" \
  --result success || true
```

#### 7c. Report Completion

```
Task Complete: {task.id} - {task.title}

Phases: {N} completed
Workers: {list}
Files touched: {count}

Key decisions:
- {decision 1}
- {decision 2}

Learning captured: workspace/learnings/{project}/{task-id}.json
PRD updated: passes: true
```

#### 7c.5 iMessage Notify (if configured)

Check `settings/contacts.yaml` for contacts whose `context` list includes the current project name. For each matching contact, send a brief completion update via iMessage:

```bash
# Count completed vs total stories
COMPLETED=$(grep -c '"passes": true' "${prdPath}" || echo 0)
TOTAL=$(python3 -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('${prdPath}'))['userStories']))")
PCT=$((COMPLETED * 100 / TOTAL))

~/scripts/imessage.sh "{contact.imessage}" \
  "{project} update: {task.title} is done! $COMPLETED/$TOTAL stories complete ($PCT%)"
```

Best-effort — never block task completion on iMessage delivery. Log and continue if Messages.app errors.

#### 7d. Structured Output for Orchestrator

When invoked as a sub-agent by `/run-project`, end with this JSON so the orchestrator can parse results without absorbing full context:

```json
{
  "task_id": "{task.id}",
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "1-sentence summary of what was accomplished",
  "workers_used": ["{worker1}", "{worker2}"],
  "models_used": {"worker1": "opus", "worker2": "sonnet"},
  "back_pressure": {
    "tests": "pass|fail|skipped",
    "lint": "pass|fail|skipped",
    "typecheck": "pass|fail|skipped",
    "build": "pass|fail|skipped",
    "e2e_manifest": "pass|fail|skipped"
  }
}
```

### 8. Handle Failures

If any phase fails after retry:

#### 8.0 Release Locks and Checkout on Failure

Same as step 7.0 — release all file locks for this story from both `.file-locks.json` and state.json. Also release the story checkout: read state.json, verify `current_task.checkedOutBy.pid` matches the PID acquired in step 5.0.5, and if so set `current_task.checkedOutBy = null` and write state.json back. Never orphan locks or checkouts on failure.

#### 8.0.5 Auto-Capture Failure as Learning

Run `/learn` with:

```json
{
  "source": "back-pressure-failure",
  "severity": "high",
  "scope": "worker:{failed-worker-id}",
  "back_pressure_failures": [{"worker": "...", "check": "...", "error": "..."}],
  "task_id": "{task.id}",
  "project": "{project}"
}
```

This ensures the failure becomes a rule BEFORE asking the user what to do.

#### 8.0.6 Audit: Task Failed

```bash
scripts/audit-log.sh append \
  --event task_failed \
  --project {project} \
  --story-id {task.id} \
  --company {company} \
  --session-id {started_at} \
  --worker {failed_worker} \
  --error "{error_message}" \
  --action "Task failed at phase {N}: {failed_worker}" \
  --result fail || true
```

#### 8.1 Update Execution State

Write `status: "paused"` to the execution tracking file with error details.

#### 8.2 Report Failure

```
Phase {N} ({worker}) failed: {error}

Options:
1. Fix manually and resume: /execute-task {project}/{task-id} --resume
2. Skip this worker and continue
3. Abort execution
```

When invoked as a sub-agent, also output structured JSON on failure:

```json
{
  "task_id": "{task.id}",
  "status": "failed",
  "summary": "Phase {N} ({worker}) failed: {brief error}",
  "workers_used": ["{workers that ran}"],
  "back_pressure": {}
}
```

### 9. Auto-Checkpoint

After task completion (or failure), write a thread checkpoint file:

```json
{
  "thread_id": "T-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}-auto-{task-id}",
  "version": 1,
  "type": "auto-checkpoint",
  "created_at": "{ISO8601}",
  "updated_at": "{ISO8601}",
  "workspace_root": "~/HQ",
  "cwd": "{current working directory}",
  "git": {
    "branch": "{current branch from git branch --show-current}",
    "current_commit": "{short hash from git rev-parse --short HEAD}",
    "dirty": false
  },
  "conversation_summary": "Executed {task.id} ({task.title}): {1-sentence outcome}",
  "files_touched": ["{list of files created or modified across all phases}"],
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Auto: execute-task {project}/{task-id}",
    "tags": ["auto-checkpoint", "execute-task", "{project}", "{task-id}"],
    "trigger": "worker-completion"
  }
}
```

Write to: `workspace/threads/{thread_id}.json`

Get git state with:

```bash
git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null
git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null
git status --short 2>/dev/null
```

## Handoff Context Format

Context passed between workers:

```json
{
  "from_worker": "backend-dev",
  "to_worker": "code-reviewer",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "summary": "1-2 sentence description",
  "files_created": ["src/services/foo.ts"],
  "files_modified": ["src/index.ts"],
  "key_decisions": [
    "Used strategy pattern for flexibility",
    "Added caching for performance"
  ],
  "context_for_next": "Focus review on cache invalidation logic",
  "back_pressure": {
    "tests": "pass",
    "lint": "pass",
    "typecheck": "pass"
  }
}
```

## Worked Example: Complete End-to-End Task Execution

This example shows a real task execution from start to finish, demonstrating task loading, classification, worker sequencing, phase execution, and completion.

### Scenario: API Endpoint Implementation

**Task:** `POST /api/v1/orders/{id}/cancel` endpoint to allow customers to cancel pending orders.

### Step 1: Parse Arguments & Load Task

```
Input: /execute-task order-system/US-003
```

**Task spec loaded:**

```json
{
  "id": "US-003",
  "title": "Implement Cancel Order Endpoint",
  "description": "Add POST /api/v1/orders/{id}/cancel endpoint that cancels pending orders and notifies customer",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Endpoint returns 400 if order not in 'pending' state",
    "Endpoint sends cancellation email to customer",
    "Endpoint logs action with order ID and timestamp",
    "All code passes lint and tests"
  ],
  "passes": false,
  "files": [
    "apps/api/src/routes/orders.ts",
    "apps/api/src/services/order-service.ts",
    "apps/api/src/emails/order-cancelled.ts"
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Classify Task Type

```
Analyzing task indicators:
- "endpoint" -> api_development
- "POST /api" -> REST endpoint
- "services" -> backend service
- "emails" -> integration

Classification: api_development
Matched indicators: endpoint, service, email notification
```

### Step 3: Select Worker Sequence

```
Task Type: api_development
Spec Clarity: clear acceptance criteria

Worker Sequence:
Phase 1: backend-dev -> Implement service
Phase 2: code-reviewer -> Review changes
Phase 3: codex-reviewer -> Mandatory security/quality review
Phase 4: dev-qa-tester -> Verify implementation

Proceeding with 4-phase pipeline.
```

### Step 4: Initialize Execution State

```
Creating execution file: workspace/orchestrator/order-system/executions/US-003.json

{
  "task_id": "US-003",
  "project": "order-system",
  "started_at": "2026-03-08T14:35:22Z",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "current_phase": 1,
  "phases": [
    {"worker": "backend-dev", "status": "pending"},
    {"worker": "code-reviewer", "status": "pending"},
    {"worker": "codex-reviewer", "status": "pending"},
    {"worker": "dev-qa-tester", "status": "pending"}
  ],
  "handoffs": [],
  "codex_debug_attempts": []
}
```

### Step 5: Phase 1 — backend-dev

**Worker output (JSON):**

```json
{
  "summary": "Implemented POST /api/v1/orders/{id}/cancel endpoint with state validation and email notification",
  "files_created": [
    "apps/api/src/emails/order-cancelled.ts"
  ],
  "files_modified": [
    "apps/api/src/routes/orders.ts",
    "apps/api/src/services/order-service.ts"
  ],
  "key_decisions": [
    "Used order state machine pattern (pending -> cancelled transition only)",
    "Email notification async to prevent timeout on customer signal path",
    "Added database transaction to ensure order + audit log atomicity"
  ],
  "context_for_next": "Focus review on transaction semantics. Verify email template vars match order schema (customer_name, order_id, created_at). Check cancellation reasons logged to audit table.",
  "back_pressure": {
    "tests": "pass",
    "lint": "pass",
    "typecheck": "pass",
    "build": "pass"
  },
  "issues": []
}
```

**Files created/modified summary:**

```
apps/api/src/emails/order-cancelled.ts (52 new lines)
apps/api/src/routes/orders.ts (+18 lines, cancel route added)
apps/api/src/services/order-service.ts (+31 lines, cancelOrder method added)

All back pressure checks pass:
npm test (42 passed, 0 failed)
npm run lint (0 issues)
npm run check (0 TS errors)
```

### Step 6: Phase 2 — code-reviewer

**Worker receives handoff context:**

```
From: backend-dev
Summary: Implemented cancel endpoint with state validation and email

Key files: orders.ts, order-service.ts, order-cancelled.ts
Decision: Used state machine pattern for order transitions
Focus: Verify transaction semantics and email template vars
```

**Worker output (JSON):**

```json
{
  "summary": "Code review passed. State machine pattern correct. Transaction boundaries validated. Email template vars match schema.",
  "files_created": [],
  "files_modified": [],
  "key_decisions": [
    "Confirmed transaction includes both order update and audit log insert",
    "Email template correctly references order.customer_name (not customer.name)",
    "Error handling appropriate: 400 for non-pending orders, 500 for service errors"
  ],
  "context_for_next": "Code changes are production-ready. Codex will provide additional security perspective. QA should test: cancel pending order (success), cancel completed order (400 error), email delivery timing.",
  "back_pressure": {
    "tests": "pass",
    "lint": "pass",
    "typecheck": "pass",
    "build": "pass"
  },
  "issues": []
}
```

### Step 7: Phase 3 — codex-reviewer (Inline Execution)

**Running Codex CLI directly:**

```bash
cd repos/private/order-system && codex review --uncommitted \
  "Review changed files for: security, correctness, performance, style. Focus: API endpoint security, transaction safety, email delivery reliability"
```

**Codex output:**

```
CODEX REVIEW: order-system (uncommitted changes)

Files analyzed: 3 (73 total lines changed)

SECURITY:
- No SQL injection (using parameterized queries)
- No auth bypass (endpoint checks user.id ownership)
- Email rate limiting OK (uses queue, not inline)

CORRECTNESS:
- Transaction boundary correct (both operations in same transaction)
- Error messages don't leak internal state
- Idempotency: calling twice won't double-cancel (state check before update)

PERFORMANCE:
- Minor: Email sending is async but no timeout (could hang indefinitely)
  Suggestion: Add 30s timeout to email task

Code Quality: A
Severity: info (not critical path)
```

**Handoff for next phase:**

```
Codex review completed. One informational finding: email timeout.
Ready for QA testing. All critical checks pass.
```

### Step 8: Phase 4 — dev-qa-tester

**Receives full handoff context:**

```
Implemented: POST /api/v1/orders/{id}/cancel endpoint
Code review: Passed, state machine pattern correct
Codex security: Passed, email timeout noted as info-level
Test coverage: All unit tests passing

Your tasks:
1. Test cancel pending order -> returns 200, email sent, audit logged
2. Test cancel completed order -> returns 400, email NOT sent
3. Test auth: Verify user can only cancel own orders
```

**QA Worker Output:**

```json
{
  "summary": "All acceptance criteria verified. E2E tests pass: cancel pending (200), cancel completed (400), auth check (403 for other user orders)",
  "files_created": [
    "apps/api/tests/e2e/cancel-order.e2e.ts"
  ],
  "files_modified": [
    "apps/api/tests/cancel-order.test.ts"
  ],
  "key_decisions": [
    "Added E2E test covering auth boundary (user A cannot cancel user B's orders)",
    "Email delivery tested via mock SES (no actual email sent)",
    "Tested idempotency: cancelling twice returns 200 both times (same result)"
  ],
  "context_for_next": "All acceptance criteria met. Endpoint ready for production.",
  "back_pressure": {
    "tests": "pass",
    "lint": "pass",
    "typecheck": "pass",
    "build": "pass"
  },
  "issues": []
}
```

### Step 9: Complete Task

**Update prd.json:**

```json
{
  "id": "US-003",
  "title": "Implement Cancel Order Endpoint",
  "passes": true,
  "linearIssueId": "ORD-42",
  "notes": "Completed 2026-03-08. All phases passed (backend -> review -> codex -> qa)."
}
```

**Sync Linear:**

```
Issue ORD-42 -> Done state
Comment: "Completed by HQ. Ready for production. Codex flagged email timeout (info-level)."
```

**Final Report:**

```
Task Complete: US-003 - Implement Cancel Order Endpoint

Phases: 4 completed
Workers: backend-dev, code-reviewer, codex-reviewer, dev-qa-tester
Files touched: 5 (3 modified, 2 created with tests)

Key decisions:
- Used state machine pattern for order transitions
- Email notification async with rate limiting
- Added comprehensive auth + idempotency tests

Back pressure summary:
All tests pass (84 total)
All lint checks pass
All TypeScript checks pass
Build succeeds

Learning captured: workspace/learnings/order-system/US-003.json
PRD updated: passes: true
Linear synced: issue -> Done state
```

## Examples

```
execute-task campaign-migration/US-003    # Execute a specific story
execute-task order-system/CAM-001         # Full-stack story
execute-task landing-page/US-001          # UI component story
```

## Rules

- **ONE task at a time** — never work on multiple tasks
- **Fresh context per worker** — spawn sub-agents, don't accumulate context in the parent
- **Sub-agents must commit their own work** — orchestrator verifies no uncommitted changes after each return and commits them with a non-compliance flag if needed
- **Back pressure is mandatory** — no skipping tests/lint/typecheck
- **Quality gates before passes: true** — run `prd.metadata.qualityGates` before marking a story complete
- **Capture learnings** — every task generates a learning entry via `/learn`
- **Handoffs preserve context** — next worker knows what happened via structured JSON handoff
- **Fail fast, fail loud** — stop on errors, don't hide them
- **prd.json is required** — never read or fall back to README.md
- **Validate prd.json on load** — fail loudly on missing/malformed fields
- **File locks are per-story, per-file** — acquire on start, release on completion or failure, never orphan
- **Linear sync is best-effort** — attempt if credentials available, skip silently on failure, never block task completion
- **Cross-company guard** — before any Linear API call, verify `linearCredentials` path matches the active company per `companies/manifest.yaml`
- **Orchestrator-compatible output** — always end with structured JSON block (step 7d) so `/run-project` can parse results without absorbing full context
- **ALWAYS use agent-browser** for all browser interactions (OAuth flows, GTM, Meta, Google Ads, CIO, etc.). NEVER open headed browsers expecting manual user input — agent-browser handles auth states automatically via saved browser-state files
- **Do NOT use EnterPlanMode or TodoWrite** — /execute-task IS the planning and execution pipeline. The PRD, task classification, and worker sequencing replace ad-hoc planning. Follow the steps in order.
- **Always reindex after task completion** — `qmd update` after every completed task (step 7b.6)
- **Never rewrite the PRD** — sub-agents may only update the current story's `passes`, `notes`, and `linearIssueId` fields. Never restructure, rename, add, or remove stories. The orchestrator validates PRD integrity after each sub-agent returns.
