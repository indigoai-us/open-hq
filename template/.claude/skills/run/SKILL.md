# Run - Worker Execution

Unified interface to run workers and their skills in Codex sessions.

> **⚠️ Codex Adaptation Note — No Context Isolation**
>
> In Claude Code, `/run` spawns an isolated Task sub-agent per worker. Worker context (instructions, knowledge, policies) lives in a separate context window and does not bleed into the parent session.
>
> In Codex, workers execute **inline** in the current context window. This means:
> - Worker instructions, knowledge, and policies are loaded into **your** active context
> - Worker state and outputs are visible to the rest of the session
> - Long-running workers or knowledge-heavy workers will consume your context budget
> - Consider using `$handoff` between workers for large multi-worker sessions

**Usage:**
```
run                          # List available workers
run {worker-id}              # Show worker skills
run {worker-id} {skill}      # Run specific skill
run {worker-id} {skill} arg  # Run with argument
```

**User's input:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Step 1 — Parse Arguments

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `worker_id` — first token
- `skill` — second token (optional)
- `args` — remaining tokens (optional, passed to skill as `$ARGUMENTS`)

---

## Step 2 — Route by Input

### No Arguments → List Workers

Read `workers/registry.yaml` and display all workers:

```
Available Workers:

  x-{your-name}            X/Twitter posting for {your-name}
  cfo-{company}    Financial reporting
  {company}-analyst LR/{PRODUCT} data analysis
  ...

Usage: run {worker-id} [skill] [args]
```

Stop here.

### Worker ID Only → Show Skills

1. Read `workers/registry.yaml`
2. Find the entry matching `{worker_id}`
3. Read `{worker_path}/worker.yaml`
4. List skills from the `skills:` section

```
Worker: x-{your-name}
Description: X/Twitter posting for {your-name}

Skills:
  contentidea   Build out a content idea into posts
  suggestposts  Research and suggest posts
  scheduleposts Choose what to post now

Usage: run x-{your-name} {skill}
```

Stop here.

### Worker + Skill (+ Args) → Execute Inline

Proceed to the full execution pipeline below.

---

## Step 3 — Load Worker Context

### 3a. Find Worker Registry Entry

Use the Read tool to read `workers/registry.yaml`. The registry stores workers as a YAML list under the `workers:` key, with each entry shaped like:

```yaml
workers:
  - id: x-{your-name}
    path: companies/personal/workers/x-{your-name}/
    description: "..."
```

Scan the list for the entry where `id:` matches `{worker_id}` and extract its `path:` field. If needed, use Grep with the correct pattern to find the path:

```bash
grep -A 4 "  - id: {worker_id}$" workers/registry.yaml | grep "path:"
```

Extract the `path:` value (strip the `path: ` prefix). If no matching entry found, display:
```
Error: Worker '{worker_id}' not found in registry.
Run 'run' (no args) to list available workers.
```
Stop.

### 3b. Read worker.yaml

Read `{worker_path}/worker.yaml` in full. This contains:
- `instructions:` — the worker's accumulated knowledge and learnings
- `tools:` — permitted tools (respect these during execution)
- `knowledge:` — paths to knowledge files (load relevant ones)
- `company:` — company scope (used for policy loading)
- `skills:` — available skill definitions

### 3c. Find and Read the Skill File

Skill definitions are in `{worker_path}/skills/{skill}.md`.

If the skill file does not exist, check `worker.yaml` `skills:` section for an inline definition. If still not found:
```
Error: Skill '{skill}' not found for worker '{worker_id}'.
Run 'run {worker_id}' to see available skills.
```
Stop.

---

## Step 4 — Load Policies

Determine the company scope from:
1. `worker.yaml` `company:` field
2. Worker path prefix: `companies/{co}/workers/` → company is `{co}`
3. Fallback: no company scope

If company determined, read policies:
```bash
ls companies/{co}/policies/ 2>/dev/null
```

Read each policy file (skip `example-policy.md`). Note:
- **Hard enforcement** → treat as absolute constraints during execution
- **Soft enforcement** → note deviations, proceed

If worker targets a specific repo (from `worker.yaml` `repo:` field), also read:
```bash
ls {repoPath}/.claude/policies/ 2>/dev/null
```

---

## Step 5 — Load Knowledge

From `worker.yaml` `knowledge:` section, load relevant knowledge files referenced. Prioritize files related to the requested skill. Use:

```bash
which qmd 2>/dev/null && qmd search "{worker_id} {skill}" --json -n 5 -c hq
```

Or read knowledge files directly via Read tool if paths are specified in worker.yaml.

---

## Step 6 — Execute Skill Inline

With all context loaded (worker instructions, skill file, policies, knowledge):

1. **Understand the skill** — re-read `{skill}.md` instructions
2. **Apply worker constraints** — only use tools listed in `worker.yaml` `tools:` section
3. **Execute** — follow the skill's instructions step by step
4. **Pass arguments** — `$ARGUMENTS` in the skill file refers to the args from `$ARGUMENTS` (tokens after `{worker_id} {skill}`)
5. **Verify** — run any verification steps defined in the skill file

> **Context reminder:** You are executing inline. Keep responses focused. If the skill involves large knowledge loads or multi-step research, note the context cost at the start of execution.

---

## Step 7 — Auto-Checkpoint

After skill completion, write a thread checkpoint file:

```json
{
  "thread_id": "T-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}-{worker_id}-{skill}",
  "version": 1,
  "type": "auto-checkpoint",
  "created_at": "{ISO8601}",
  "updated_at": "{ISO8601}",
  "workspace_root": "~/HQ",
  "cwd": "{current working directory}",
  "git": {
    "branch": "{current branch from git branch --show-current}",
    "current_commit": "{short hash from git rev-parse --short HEAD}",
    "dirty": "{true if git status --short output is non-empty, false otherwise}"
  },
  "conversation_summary": "Ran {worker_id}/{skill}: {1-sentence description of what was accomplished}",
  "files_touched": ["{list of files created or modified}"],
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Auto: {worker_id} {skill}",
    "tags": ["auto-checkpoint", "{worker_id}", "{skill}"],
    "trigger": "worker-completion"
  }
}
```

Write to: `workspace/threads/{thread_id}.json`

Get git state with:
```bash
git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null
git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null
git status --short 2>/dev/null
```

Set `dirty: true` if `git status --short` output is non-empty; `false` if empty.

## Examples

```
run                              # See all workers
run x-{your-name}                      # See x-{your-name} skills
run x-{your-name} contentidea          # Run contentidea skill
run x-{your-name} contentidea "AI workforce"  # Run with topic arg
run cfo-{company} mrr          # Run MRR report
run {company}-analyst weekly   # Run weekly analysis
```

## Notes

- **No isolation** — worker context bleeds into your session. This is the key difference from Claude Code.
- **Tool constraints** — only use tools listed in `worker.yaml` `tools:` while executing the skill.
- **Knowledge loading** — load only knowledge relevant to the skill; don't load everything.
- **Context budget** — for heavy workers (large knowledge bases, complex skills), warn the user upfront. Suggest `$handoff` before and after if context budget is a concern.
- **Worker path lookup** — always read `workers/registry.yaml` first. Never Glob for `worker.yaml`.
- **Skill args** — `$ARGUMENTS` in skill files is replaced by everything after `{worker_id} {skill}` in the user's input.
