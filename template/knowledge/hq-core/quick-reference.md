## Command ↔ Skill Shapes

Every command exists as `.claude/commands/{name}.md` (the slash-command entry point) and most have a paired `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` (the Skill-tool canonical logic). Two valid shapes:

**Consolidated (default for new commands)** — `.md` is a ~20-line delegator stub, `SKILL.md` holds the canonical logic. One source of truth, no drift. Converted pairs (Phase 3.1 audit): `search`, `audit-log`, `brainstorm`, `startwork`, `prd`, `handoff`, `learn`, `execute-task`.

**Thin-router split (only one)** — `run-project`. The `.md` is the canonical docs/flags/examples source (622 lines). The `SKILL.md` is a ~66-line bash wrapper that execs `scripts/run-project.sh`. They stay forked because one is human-facing documentation and the other is a dispatch shim — different jobs, neither redundant.

**Intentional exceptions (metadata stubs, no SKILL.md)** — `review`, `investigate`, `retro`, `document-release`, `review-plan`. These are frontmatter-only commands that dispatch prompts; no skill logic to split.

**Rule for new commands:** start with the consolidated shape — write the canonical logic in `SKILL.md`, leave `.md` as a stub copying `.claude/commands/startwork.md`'s shape (frontmatter → H1 → intro → `## Steps` → `## After`). Only fork if you have a genuine thin-router reason like `run-project`.

## Knowledge Bases

**Public** (`knowledge/public/`): Ralph, ai-security-framework, agent-browser, curious-minds, design-styles, dev-team, gemini-cli, hq-core, loom, projects, workers

**Private** (`knowledge/private/`): linear

**Company-level** (`companies/{co}/knowledge/`): All 14 companies have embedded git repos.
