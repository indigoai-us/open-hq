# Queue Operations

Centralized queue.json management. All social-team workers use these operations instead of directly reading/writing queue files.

## Queue File Locations (from social-kit.yaml)

- Personal: `workspace/social-drafts/queue.json`
- {Product}: `companies/{company}/data/social-drafts/queue.json`
- {Product}: `companies/{company}/data/social-drafts/queue.json`

## Operations

### readQueue(profileName)
1. Get `queue_file` path from social-kit.yaml for the profile
2. Read and parse the JSON file
3. Return entries array

### writeQueue(profileName, entries)
1. Get `queue_file` path from social-kit.yaml
2. Write entries as formatted JSON
3. Log the write to api-log.jsonl

### findEntry(profileName, draftId)
Find a specific entry by `id` field or by matching slug in `draftFile` path.

### updateEntryStatus(profileName, draftId, newStatus, extraFields)
1. Read queue
2. Find entry
3. Update `status` and merge `extraFields` (e.g., `postUrl`, `postBridgeId`, `postedAt`)
4. Write queue
5. If status is `posted` or `verified`: also append to `posted.json`

### getNextApproved(profileName, platform)
1. Read queue
2. Filter where `status === "approved"` and platform matches
