# HQ by Indigo

Personal OS for AI Workers. **HQ** is free and open-source — install, personalize, and run AI agents from your terminal with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). **HQ Cloud** (paid) adds cross-device sync, a mobile dashboard, and managed infrastructure.

## Install

```bash
npx create-hq
```

This creates an HQ directory with commands, workers, knowledge bases, and project scaffolding. Then open it in Claude Code and run the setup wizard:

```bash
cd hq
claude
/setup
```

## What's Inside

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `.claude/commands/` | 44 slash commands for session management, workers, projects, content, design |
| `workers/` | 28+ AI workers (dev team, content team, QA, security, finance) |
| `knowledge/` | Knowledge bases (Ralph methodology, design styles, security, worker framework) |
| `.claude/skills/` | 44+ skills (design, animate, polish, review, audit, and more) |
| `workspace/` | Threads, checkpoints, reports, social drafts |

## HQ Teams

Share a workspace with your team — an admin creates a team backed by a private GitHub repo, invites members, and everyone gets synchronized team content alongside their personal HQ.

```bash
# Admin: create a team
npx create-hq
# Choose "Create an HQ Teams account" → pick org → invite members

# Member: accept an invite
npx create-hq --invite hq_<token>
```

Team content lives at `companies/{slug}/` as an embedded git repo. [Read the Teams docs →](https://hq-teams-docs.vercel.app)

## Cloud Sync

Sync your HQ to the cloud for mobile access:

```bash
npm install -g @indigoai-us/hq-cli
hq sync init        # Authenticate with IndigoAI
hq sync start       # Start background sync
```

Access your HQ from any device at [hq.indigoai.com](https://hq.indigoai.com).

## Module Management

Keep your HQ updated with the latest commands, workers, and knowledge:

```bash
hq modules sync     # Pull latest updates
hq modules list     # See installed modules
hq modules add <repo-url>  # Add external modules
```
